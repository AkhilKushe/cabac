Before 15/05/23


Issues with interface:
M axi inteface not supported for co simulation (or maybe but giving error)
stream interface aggrigates the struct into single packet, thus cannot have wider packets



Maxi working

**** Struct data currupted at top level interface, currently using stream interface
	- try struct padding -> solved by configuring maxi bus for struct




6 JUNE TODO :
1. + Get bitstream from dat file (1 CTU), DONE
2. Complete CTU Tree code, 
	+ done coding unit
	- initializer for all units
	+ done cu recursive wrapper
	+ done top ctu call

3. + Interface
4. + Fix all initialization of arith state for first ctu, pass and recieve state info
5. Extract output Vectors and add verification step into test bench.
6. Add support for passing neighbour values
7. Clean code

Future scope:
adding error control -> hardware prone to hangs
						-> very control sensitive algorithm
Splitting functional unit into seperate tpo reduce synthesis complexity and time


Notes : 
Simulation time 1 CTU  : 3115735 ns
